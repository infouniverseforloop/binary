# Binary Sniper God — Full Final

Ultra-premium binary sniper signal system (backend + frontend).  
Designed for Replit / GitHub deployment.

## Quick start
1. Create project and paste files.
2. `npm install`
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example` (do not commit).
4. `node server.js` (or set Run command in Replit).
5. Open Replit URL -> press Start or Auto-Pick.

## Notes
- Many broker / cloud / news features are safe placeholders — provide real API credentials to enable.
- Martingale advisor suggests only; it does not place trades automatically.
- Use `.env` and Replit secrets for sensitive credentials.
